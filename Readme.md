**G2P2C** is a project to develop Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS), with the aim to automate treatment in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). 

![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) `Notes/Update: In 2024, we released RL4T1D: https://github.com/RL4H/RL4T1D, which is based on this original codebase (G2P2C). The new project simplifies and improves the process of integrating new RL algorithms, managing the interface between the environments/agents, experimentation pipelines, logging, and benchmarking. Future work will be based on RL4T1D. Further supplementary resources: CAPSML (2021-present): https://capsml.com/, GluCoEnv: https://github.com/RL4H/GluCoEnv.`

**Background:** Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is casued by the autoimmune destruction of the islet beta-cells and results in absolute insulin deficiency (cover image: Human islet of Langerhans created by Stable Diffusion). Hence, external administration of insulin is required to maintain glucose levels, which is cruicial as both low and high glucose levels are detrimental to health. This is usually done through an insulin pump attached to the body. An continuous glucose sensor is also attached to measure the glucose levels so that a control algorithm can estimate the appropriate insulin dose. In this project we design Reinforcement Learning (RL) based Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS) for the glucose control problem. The figure below shows the main components of an APS.

</p>

Maintaining glucose levels is a life-long optimisation problem, complicated due to the disturbances associated with daily events (meals, exercise, stress.. etc), delays present in glucose sensing and insulin action, partial observability, and safety constraints among others. A simulation of glucose regulation, using a RL-based strategy is shown below, where the optimal glucose range is shaded in green severe hypoglycemia / hyperglycemia ranges highlighted by the red dotted line. The blood glucose measurements are presented in the top, while the administered insulin by the RL agent is presented in the bottom. The disturbances related to meal events and the carbohydrate content of the meals are presented in red.

![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) `Note: Existing classical control algorithms (PID, MPC) can successfully control glucose levels well when there is limited disturbances and uncertainty. However, during daily MEALS (a disturbance to the system) people with T1D have to be pro-active (to reduce uncertainty) and plan in advance (typically decide 20-minutes in advance what they will be having and manually estimate the amount of carbohydrates present in the meal). This adds a significant cognitive burden, and errors associated with the manual process (e.g., estimating carbs) leads to sub-optimal glucose regulation. Therefore, in this work the main aim is to fully automate treatment, where the RL algorithms are not given any information related to upcoming meal events or carb contents and tested against challenging meal protocols (e.g., meals with large CHO for large disturbances, simulate the real world with skipped meals). If these conditions are relaxed, existing methods perform very well.`

Example training curves of RL algorithms for selected in-silico subjects are presented below (the mean and standard deviation of the total reward achieved against environment steps for evaluation simulations are presented). The in-silico subjects can be considered as unique environments, Adolescent6 is the hardest to control while Adolescent0 is the easiest. Please refer publications below for detailed results and comparisons against standard clinical treatment approaches.

Performance comparison of clinical treatment strategies (BBI, BBHE: these require manual meal announcement and CHO estimation) and RL strategis (please find a comparison against other implementations of RL-based strategies in previous work in our [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809423012727)). G2P2C achieved a better reward performance against other RL algorithms and comparable performance against clinical strategies in the adult in-silico cohort.

![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) `Note: For RL, each in-silico subject can be considered as a unique environment. It is important to test against the full cohorts of the in-silico population, due to their varying glucose dynamics which results in some subjects being very easy to control while some are much harder. The results of our best performing RL algorithm (G2P2C) against different subjects is presented below (the ranking of the difficulty was consistent across other RL algorithms as well, refer publications for detailed results). `

Project Contributions
-- 
* We formulate the glucose regulation problem as a continuing continous control problem in an POMDP environemnt. We use the average reward RL setting and the Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm to develop a system which eliminates the requirement of carbohydrate estimation aiming to reduce the cognitive burden on people with T1D [[Paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9871054) .<br>
* The control space (i.e., the insulin secretion rate) consists of very small doses of insulin known as basal insulin and larger doses called bolus insulin which is used to counter large glucose fluctuations. We propose a non-linear continuous action space, inspired by clinical treatment to overcome challenges (skewed action distribution / redundant actions) associated with the continuous action space which improves the performance and efficiency in learning  [[Paper]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-22695-3_39) .<br>
* G2P2C: Glucose Control by Glucose Prediction and Planning, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on PPO, which introduced two auxiliary phases; model learning and planning. The model learning phase learns a glucose dynamics model while the planning phase fine-tunes the learnt policy to a short-horizon to counter the short-term fluctuations of glucose. The system eliminates the need for carbohydrate estimation and meal announcement [[Paper]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809423012727).
